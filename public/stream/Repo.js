/**
 * A Stream whose values are commit records.
 *
 * Every write goes through a commit: checkout() → set() → commit(). This makes
 * every connected device an equal author — writes are content-addressed,
 * signed, and append-only. The server is just another peer; the keypair is the
 * identity and the commit log is the source of truth.
 *
 * get() and set() are overridden to be transparent: callers use the same API
 * as Stream. get() reads from the last commit's dataAddress; set() creates a
 * new commit automatically.
 *
 * The raw stream (commit log) is what gets synced over WebSocket, S3, and
 * archives. checkout() returns a working Stream at any commit's dataAddress
 * for read-only inspection or direct use with the explicit commit() API.
